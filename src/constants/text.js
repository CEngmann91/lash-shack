If you are not satisfied with the work performed, we require that you return to the salon so that your hair can be visually inspected. At that time, we will make every effort to make any adjustments to your satisfaction by rescheduling you with the stylist who performed the initial service. Adjustments are made available to you, but only within 3 days of the initial service.",
